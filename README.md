# occ-coding-tests: demo and test of occupation coding tools

# Introduction
## About
This repo aims to (1) demonstrate the use of tools for coding occupation descriptions to the ISCO-08 scheme, and (2) serve as a demonstration of the efficacy "accuracy" of these approaches relative to a common baseline test data set.
## Installation

### Pre-commit actions
This repository contains a configuration of pre-commit hooks. These are language agnostic and focussed on repository security (such as detection of passwords and API keys). If approaching this project as a developer, you are encouraged to install and enable `pre-commits` by running the following in your shell:
   1. Install `pre-commit`:

      ```
      pip install pre-commit
      ```
   2. Enable `pre-commit`:

      ```
      pre-commit install
      ```
Once pre-commits are activated, whenever you commit to this repository a series of checks will be executed. The pre-commits include checking for security keys, large files and unresolved merge conflict headers. The use of active pre-commits are highly encouraged and the given hooks can be expanded with Python or R specific hooks that can automate the code style and linting. For example, the `flake8` and `black` hooks are useful for maintaining consistent Python code formatting.

**NOTE:** Pre-commit hooks execute Python, so it expects a working Python build.
